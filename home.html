        WebAssembly
      </section>
      <section>
        What?
      </section>


    </section>
    <section>What is it??</section>

    <section>Let's get back to basics. You want to run something on computer</section>

    <section>Goal: you want to tell the computer what to do.</section>

    <section>Problem: you and the computer speak different languages.</section>

    <section>
      You speak a human language, and the computer speaks a machine language

    </section>

    <section>Solution : Programming Language. They are a bridge between Human thought & Machine processing</section>

    <section>
      But ! Sometimes the bridge is like this

    <section>
      Assembly
      mox a 1
      mov b 2
      add a b
      push c
    </section>

    <section>
      Lower Level Language
      // code example of C/C++/Rust
    </section>

    <section>
      Higher Level Language
      // code example of Javascript
    </section>

    <section>So, what's the problem then??</section>

    <section>Higher Level -> Less Efficient</section>

    <section>
      <p>Example code of Js using dynamic variables</p>
      <img data-src="images/code.png">
      <p>Problem : We don't know the type of b.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      One Solution :
      eg. var a = 10;
      var b = a | 0;
      console.log(b);
      Explanation : This will always make sure that b will always be a 32 bit int

      This is ASM.JS

    <section>
      <section>
        Now What is WebAssembly then?
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>It is an extension to ASM.js</p>
        <p>A new low-level binary format for the web</p>
        <p>Compiled from other languages</p>
        <p>Offer maximised performance</p>
        <p>Portable</p>
