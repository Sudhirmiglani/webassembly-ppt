        WebAssembly
      </section>
      <section>
        What?
      </section>


    </section>
    <section>What is it??</section>

    <section>Let's get back to basics. You want to run something on computer</section>

    <section>Goal: you want to tell the computer what to do.</section>

    <section>Problem: you and the computer speak different languages.</section>

    <section>
      You speak a human language, and the computer speaks a machine language

    </section>

    <section>Solution : Programming Language. They are a bridge between Human thought & Machine processing</section>

    <section>
      But ! Sometimes the bridge is like this

      Assembly
      mox a 1
      mov b 2
      add a b
      push c
    </section>

    <section>
      Lower Level Language
      // code example of C/C++/Rust
    </section>

    <section>
      Higher Level Language
      // code example of Javascript
    </section>

    <section>So, what's the problem then??</section>

    <section>Higher Level -> Less Efficient</section>

    <section>
      Example code of Js using dynamic variables
      eg. var a = 10;
      var b = a;
      console.log(b);
      Problem : We don't know the type of b.
    </section>

    <section>
      One Solution :
      eg. var a = 10;
      var b = a | 0;
      console.log(b);
      Explanation : This will always make sure that b will always be a 32 bit int

      This is ASM.JS

    <section>
      <section>
        Now What is WebAssembly then?
      </section>

      <section>
        It is an extension to ASM.js.
        WebAssembly defines an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that gets stored in a binary format. Binary is great because
        it means we can create smaller app bundles.
      </section>

      <section>
        WebAssembly fills in the gaps
        that would be awkward to fill
        with JavaScript.

      <section>
        Where going to use WebAssembly
      </section>

      <section>
        Games, VR, Augmented Reality
      </section>

      <section>
        Let's see some action now
