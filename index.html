        What?
      </section>


    </section>
    <section>What is it??</section>

    <section>Let's get back to basics. You want to run something on computer</section>

    <section>Goal: you want to tell the computer what to do.</section>

    <section>Problem: you and the computer speak different languages.</section>

    <section>
      You speak a human language, and the computer speaks a machine language

    </section>

    <section>Solution : Programming Language. They are a bridge between Human thought & Machine processing</section>

    <section>
      But ! Sometimes the bridge is like this

      Assembly
      mox a 1
      mov b 2
      add a b
      push c

      Lower Level Language
      // code example of C/C++/Rust
    </section>

    <section>
      Higher Level Language
      // code example of Javascript
    </section>

    <section>So, what's the problem then??</section>

    <section>Higher Level -> Less Efficient</section>

    <section>
      Example code of Js using dynamic variables
      eg. var a = 10;
          var b = a;
          console.log(b);
      Problem : We don't know the type of b.
    </section>

    <section>
    One Solution :
    eg. var a = 10;
    var b = a | 0;
    console.log(b);
    Explanation : This will always make sure that b will always be a 32 bit int
